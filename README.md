## ðŸŒ„ What is Importer?

Importer is a CLI tool to allow any file to import other file content, including Markdown, YAML, to name a few. Importer uses **Importer Markers**, which are often provided as comment, to find the relevant file and import defined lines based on line numbers and other details.

Files such as Markdown and YAML which are meant to be a single file input can pull in other files. Importer aims to provide this extra feature without breaking the language syntax. Importer accomplishes this with a code generation approach, where the **Markers** are used to update the file in place.

This may seem like an unnecessary layer for simple files such as Markdown and YAML, but this allows better structure and code reuse, while retaining or even enhancing code readability.

## ðŸ–‹ Markers

<!-- == imptr: basic-marker / begin from: ./docs/details/markers.md#[basic-marker] == -->

**Markers** are a simple comment with special syntax Importer understands. Importer is a simple CLI tool, and these markers are the key to make all the import and export to happen. There are several types of markers.

| Name                 | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Importer Marker      | Main marker, used to import data from other file.              |
| Exporter Marker      | Supplemental marker used to define line range in target files. |
| Skip Importer Update | Special marker to suppress `importer update`.                  |
| Auto Generated Note  | Special marker for `importer generate` information.            |

<!-- == imptr: basic-marker / end == -->

You can find more about the markers [here](/docs/details/markers.md).

## ðŸš€ Examples

### `importer preview`

<!-- == imptr: preview-desc / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/examples-yaml.md#[preview-desc] == -->

`importer preview` command gives you a quick look at how the file may change when `importer update` and `importer purge` are run against the provided file. This is meant to be useful for testing and debugging.

<!-- == imptr: preview-desc / end == -->

<!-- == imptr: example-preview / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/examples-yaml.md#[preview] == -->

<!-- == imptr: example-preview / end == -->

### `importer generate`

<!-- == imptr: generate-desc / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/examples-yaml.md#[generate-desc] == -->

`importer generate` imports based on Importer Markers in the given file, and write the result to stdout or file. This can be used for debugging, or create a template file with Importer Markers but keep the file purely for Importer Markers.

<!-- == imptr: generate-desc / end == -->

<!-- == imptr: example-generate / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/examples-yaml.md#[generate] == -->

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23435099/136703617-9f11e97b-3a87-449a-a5a1-698139392465.mp4

<!-- == imptr: example-generate / end == -->

### `importer purge`

<!-- == imptr: purge-desc / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/examples-yaml.md#[purge-desc] == -->

`importer purge` removes any lines between Importer Markers in the given file, and update the file in place. The same operation is executed for `importer update` before importing all the lines, but this "purge" is sometimes useful to see the file without extra data imported.

<!-- == imptr: purge-desc / end == -->

<!-- == imptr: example-purge / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/examples-yaml.md#[purge] == -->

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23435099/136700548-6c11e599-1cda-4c30-bcfd-840a2c075e37.mp4

## :octocat: GitHub Action Integration

<!-- == imptr: getting-started-github-action / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/github-actions.md#[with-homebrew] == -->

Because you can install Importer using Homebrew, you can set up GitHub Action definition such as below:

<!--TODO: The below YAML is exactly where Importer should be able to pull in the actual file content-->

```yaml
jobs:
  importer:
    name: Run Importer Generate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Importer
        run: brew install upsidr/tap/importer

      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Run Importer against README.md
        run: importer update README.md
      - name: Check if README.md has any change compared to the branch
        run: |
          git status --short
          git diff-index --quiet HEAD
```

This repository uses Importer to generate some of the markdown documentation.

You can find actually running CI setup in [`.github/workflows/importer-ci.yaml`](/.github/workflows/importer-ci.yaml).
