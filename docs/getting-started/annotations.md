# Annotations

## ðŸ“Œ Importer Annotation

Importer's most important syntax is its annotation. Each annotation has `begin` and `end` to ensure easy usage and reproducibility.

### Basic Syntax

An annotation is a simple comment with special syntax, and thus is slightly different based on the file.

The below is a simple example for **Markdown**.

```markdown
<!-- == imptr: getting-started-install / begin from: ./docs/getting-started/install.md#[homebrew-install] == -->
```
