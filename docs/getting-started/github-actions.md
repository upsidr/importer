## :octocat: GitHub Action Integration

<!-- == export: with-homebrew / begin == -->

Because you can install Importer using Homebrew, you can set up GitHub Action definition such as below:

<!--TODO: The below YAML is exactly where Importer should be able to pull in the actual file content-->

```yaml
jobs:
  importer:
    name: Run Importer Generate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Importer
        run: brew install upsidr/tap/importer

      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Run Importer against README.md
        run: importer generate README.md
      - name: Check if README.md has any change compared to the branch
        run: |
          git status --short
          git diff-index --quiet HEAD
```

This repository uses Importer to generate some of the markdown documentation.

You can find actually running CI setup in [`.github/workflows/importer-markdown-ci.yaml`](https://github.com/upsidr/importer/blob/main/.github/workflows/importer-markdown-ci.yaml).
